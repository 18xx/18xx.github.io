<h3>2.3 - When can you first sell shares in a company?</h3>

<p>After it has operated.</p>

<h3>2.4 - Does the bank pool have a per-company share limit?</h3>

<p>50%.</p>

<h3>2.6 - What are the player certificate limits for shares in one company?</h3>

<p>60%. This may be exceeded by minor company exchange but the excess must then be sold at the next opportunity.</p>

<h3>2.7 - Does the stock price drop when stock is sold?</h3>

<p>Yes, 1 row (down and to the left) per block.</p>

<h3>2.8 - Does the stock price go up at the end of the share dealing round for a fully-held corporation?</h3>

<p>Yes: up and (left if someone holds 50% or more, else right).</p>

<h3>2.9 - Can you buy a certificate and immediately sell a certificate in the same company?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>2.11 - What ends a share dealing round?</h3>

<p>Round ends as in 1830, priority assigned as in 1829. The designer&#39;s intention was as in 1830.</p>

<h3>3.1 - Do you lay the base station token immediately upon floating?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>3.2 - How many shares must be sold for a company to float?</h3>

<h3>3.3 - Does a company get full capitalisation upon floating?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>3.4 - How is a share company&#39;s initial (par) price determined?</h3>

<p>The three National Railways have fixed par prices. For the seven major companies the initial price is set by the player who purchases the Director&#39;s certificate, choosing a value selected from a range of predefined prices.</p>

<h3>4.1 - In what order do companies operate?</h3>

<p>Current &#39;dynamic&#39; share price. By &#39;dynamic&#39;, this means that each time a company finishes operating, you look at the current stock price chart to see who is next.  The highest value company that has not operated operates next. If two companies occupy the same space, the company with a token on top operates next. If two companies have the same value but are in different spaces, the company with a token furthest to the right operates next.</p>

<h3>4.2 - If you sell shares so that their tokens end up in one stack, what order are they stacked in?</h3>

<p>Unknown, but will be grateful for information.</p>

<h3>5.1 - Where can you make an initial tile lay?</h3>

<p>As for 1830. (rule V.3)</p>

<h3>5.2 - Can you lay two tiles in a turn?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>5.3 - Must a tile replacement extend existing track?</h3>

<p>According to the printed rules, restrictive (rule VI.1). This means that certain tiles can never be laid, and is a mistake. The designer Leonhard Orgler has stated (personal communication to Steve Thomas) that it should be semi-restrictive.</p>

<h3>5.4 - Do villages upgrade?</h3>

<p>Yes, single villages acquire bypasses, double villages coalesce.</p>

<h3>6.1 - Cost of station markers</h3>

<p>0, then 20<em>hex distance, then 40</em>hex distance. Distance measured by &#39;a crow without a passport&#39;.</p>

<h3>6.2 - Can you lay more than one station marker per turn?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>6.3 - Where can you lay a station marker?</h3>

<p>The newly-laid station marker must be connected by track to one belonging to that company; but this track may include one (arguably, more than one) sharp angle that would prevent a train from running over it: &quot;Ein Fahrtrichtungswechsel ist hierbei erlaubt&quot;. For 1837 the designer&#39;s intention was to allow no more than one backtrack.</p>

<h3>6.4 - When is a company&#39;s first station marker laid?</h3>

<p>When it is floated.</p>

<h3>7.1 - Can you run into a city completely filled by rival station markers?</h3>

<p>Coal trains visit and get paid for villages without restriction. Express trains ignore villages.</p>

<h3>7.5 - Is double-heading allowed?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>7.6 - Rules about villages</h3>

<p>As for 1835 and 1847, but N+n trains are rarer. Also, for coal trains villages contribute to the run, but do not count towards the station count; and express trains ignore villages.</p>

<h3>7.7 - Must the maximum possible revenue be claimed?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>8.1 - Does stock move right for payment of dividends?</h3>

<p>Right for 100% payout, right and down for 50% payout.</p>

<p>Those for shares in the bank pool.</p>

<h3>8.3 - Does stock move left for withheld earnings?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>It may make a 50% payout.&nbsp; Amounts are calculated exactly, then odd half-crowns rounded in favour of the bank.</p>

<p>Once a 3 train has been bought, minimum price 1.</p>

<h3>9.2 - Must a major share company buy a train if it does not have one?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>9.3 - Can trains be sold back to the bank?</h3>

<p>No, but if at the train limit, it can pay half a train&#39;s cost to put it back in the bank, so long as it then buys a train.</p>

<h3>9.4 - When a company is forced to buy a train and cannot buy one with its own means, what train may it then buy?</h3>

<p>You can buy any available train: you may pay any agreed amount for a train from another company; you may buy any train in the bank pool; you may buy any available new train (there is typically a choice of two).</p>

<h3>9.5 - Must a minor company buy a train if it does not have one?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<p>No. But it allows a company owned by the same director to build there free.  Others have to pay.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Next qualifying player on seller&#39;s left.</p>

<h3>13.1 - Game ends immediately with a bankruptcy?</h3>

<p>Not usually. The bankrupt player&#39;s wealth is reduced to zero and they take no further part in the game. If all players but one have gone bankrupt, the game ends with the remaining player as the winner.</p>
