<p>None.</p>

<h3>2.7 - Does the stock price drop when stock is sold?</h3>

<p>Yes, if the company has operated.The price moves down once for each share sold, zig-zagging between the top and bottom levels. However, when shares are worth less than 40 or more than 150, the first share sold has no effect on the share price, i.e.  the price moves down one less space than normal. Once the 8+4 train is bought, sales do not reduce share prices.</p>

<h3>4.1 - In what order do companies operate?</h3>

<p>Current &#39;dynamic&#39; share price. By &#39;dynamic&#39;, this means that each time a company finishes operating, you look at the current stock price chart to see who is next.  The highest value company that has not operated operates next. If two companies occupy the same space, the company with a token on top operates next. If two companies have the same value but are in different spaces, the company with a token furthest to the right operates next.</p>
