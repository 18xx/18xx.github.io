<h3>2.7 - Does the stock price drop when stock is sold?</h3>

<p>Yes, 1 space per share sold. However, if the share price is above 200 or below 40, and the seller is not the company Director, ignore the first certificate sold.

<h3>2.8 - Does the stock price go up at the end of the share dealing round for a fully-held corporation?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>2.9 - Can you buy a certificate and immediately sell a certificate in the same company?</h3>

<h3>3.4 - How is a share company&#39;s initial (par) price determined?</h3>

<p>The price is set by the player who purchases the President&#39;s certificate, choosing a value selected from a range of predefined prices. For non-chartered companies, the par price is the highest price on the par chart that is equal to or lower than the initial share price.</p>

<h3>4.1 - In what order do companies operate?</h3>

<p>Current &#39;dynamic&#39; share price. By &#39;dynamic&#39;, this means that each time a company finishes operating, you look at the current stock price chart to see who is next.  The highest value company that has not operated operates next. If two companies occupy the same space, the company with a token on top operates next. If two companies have the same value but are in different spaces, the company with a token furthest to the right operates next.</p>

<h3>7.2 - Can you do a run that passes through a city completely filled by rival station markers?</h3>

<p>Not as standard, but several freight trains running end-to-end may run so that one of the train&#39;s runs stops at such a city and another starts again on the other side.</p>

<h3>7.3 - Unusual rules about running</h3>

<p>All runs must intersect with each other, forming a coherent network, with at least one train visiting the company&#39;s home base.
