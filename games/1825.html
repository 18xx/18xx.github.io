<h1>1825</h1>

<h2>Unit 1, South Eastern England, Unit 2, The Midlands and Unit 3, Scotland and Northumbria</h2>

<h3>1.2 - Does the price of a private company drop by 5 for no sale in the first round?</h3>

<p>No. One private per player dealt at random and sold compulsorily. With more than 4 players, the others get LNWR shares.</p>

<h3>1.3 - Can you sell company shares in the first round?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>1.4 - Can you make advance bids?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>2.1 - Can companies buy shares?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>2.2 - Are you limited to buying one certificate on your turn?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>2.3 - When can you first sell shares in a company?</h3>

<p>From the second stock round onwards.</p>

<h3>2.4 - Does the bank pool have a per-company share limit?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>2.6 - What are the player certificate limits for shares in one company?</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>2.7 - Does the stock price drop when stock is sold?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>2.8 - Does the stock price go up at the end of the share dealing round for a fully-held corporation?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>2.9 - Can you buy a certificate and immediately sell a certificate in the same company?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>2.11 - What ends a share dealing round?</h3>

<p>Each player consecutively not making a purchase.  The priority then goes to the player after the one who last made a purchase. In 1853 and 1853V2 he may sell the elephant that confers priority to another player.</p>

<h3>3.1 - Do you lay the base station token immediately upon floating?</h3>

<p>The token is placed on the home base at the start of the operating round in which it will first run.</p>

<h3>3.2 - How many shares must be sold for a company to float?</h3>

<p>60%.</p>

<h3>3.3 - Does a company get full capitalisation upon floating?</h3>

<p>Nine-certificate companies do, four-certificate companies don&#39;t.</p>

<h3>3.4 - How is a share company&#39;s initial (par) price determined?</h3>

<p>Major companies have fixed par prices. For minor companies the price is set by the player who purchases the Presdient&#39;s certificate, using any value on the stock market no lower than one tenth the price of the company&#39;s built-in train.</p>

<h3>4.1 - In what order do companies operate?</h3>

<p>Major companies in set order of initial value with ties broken by formation order, followed by minor companies from highest par value to lowest with ties broken by formation order.</p>

<h3>4.2 - If you sell shares so that their tokens end up in one stack, what order are they stacked in?</h3>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h3>5.1 - Where can you make an initial tile lay?</h3>

<p>As for 1830; but a hex reserved for another company may not be laid on. (rule 4.2.8)</p>

<h3>5.2 - Can you lay two tiles in a turn?</h3>

<p>Yes, if neither is an upgrade and they are not adjacent.</p>

<h3>5.3 - Must a tile replacement extend existing track?</h3>

<p>Restrictive. In addition, a city may only be upgraded if reachable from one of the laying company&#39;s station-markers by &#39;one of the Company&#39;s existing Trains&#39; (rule 4.3.2). Two &#39;2&#39; trains can be double-headed to act as a single &#39;3&#39; train for this purpose.  (rule 4.5.5). {Following this to the letter raises issues when upgrading some station tiles. For example, London has no new track, while the Birmingham/Glasgow/Manchester tiles have new track for only one station, so a company could only upgrade it if it was using this track. Having talked with Francis Tresham it was clearly not the intention to create such a restriction, so you can consider that his intention was for semi-restrictive upgrades. However, the requirement to be able to reach a station with one of the company&#39;s trains still exists.}</p>

<h3>5.4 - Do villages upgrade?</h3>

<p>Yes, to cities.</p>

<h3>6.1 - Cost of station markers</h3>

<p>0 for home bases, 40, 100.</p>

<h3>6.2 - Can you lay more than one station marker per turn?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>6.3 - Where can you lay a station marker?</h3>

<p>The newly-laid station marker must be reachable from one of the laying company&#39;s existing station markers by an arbitrarily large train.</p>

<h3>6.4 - When is a company&#39;s first station marker laid?</h3>

<p>The token is placed on the home base at the start of the operating round in which it will first run.</p>

<h3>7.1 - Can you run into a city completely filled by rival station markers?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>7.2 - Can you do a run that passes through a city completely filled by rival station markers?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>7.3 - Unusual rules about running</h3>

<h3>7.4 - Can one train run to two stations on the same tile?</h3>

<p>No, but if using Tank engines (3T, 4T) available in extension kits, these can call at two villages on the same hex or tile.</p>

<h3>7.5 - Is double-heading allowed?</h3>

<p>Yes. Two 2 trains may be used as a 3 train.</p>

<h3>7.6 - Rules about villages</h3>

<p>A run may not start nor end in a village. Double-heading (see item 7.5) reduces the severity of this restriction. Some trains included in extension kits allow runs to start or end in a village.</p>

<h3>7.7 - Must the maximum possible revenue be claimed?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>8.1 - Does stock move right for payment of dividends?</h3>

<h3>9.2 - Must a major share company buy a train if it does not have one?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>9.3 - Can trains be sold back to the bank?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>9.4 - When a company is forced to buy a train and cannot buy one with its own means, what train may it then buy?</h3>

<p>A company does not have to own a train. However, a company in receivership must buy a train as soon as funds permit unless there is no route on which it can run. While not stated, this is assumed to be from the bank.</p>

<h3>9.5 - Must a minor company buy a train if it does not have one?</h3>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h3>11.1 - Can you sell the Director&#39;s certificate into the bank pool?</h3>

<p>Yes, and is then operated by official receiver if no other player becomes the Director.</p>

<h3>11.2 - Can you exchange the Director&#39;s certificate for regular shares from another player when you sell shares to the bank pool?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>11.3 - After a sale of shares forces a change in Director, who gets it in case of a tie?</h3>

<p>Next qualifying player on seller&#39;s left.</p>

<h3>13.1 - Game ends immediately with a bankruptcy?</h3>

<p>No. A company does not have to own a train, so the player is never at risk of bankruptcy.</p>

<h3>13.2 - What happens if the bank runs out of money during an operating round?</h3>

<p>Game ends when the current OR is completed.</p>

<h3>13.3 - What happens when stock first hits the top end of the market?</h3>
