<h3>4.1 - In what order do companies operate?</h3>

<p>Current &#39;dynamic&#39; share price. By &#39;dynamic&#39;, this means that each time a company finishes operating, you look at the current stock price chart to see who is next.  The highest value company that has not operated operates next. If two companies occupy the same space, the company with a token on top operates next. If two companies have the same value but are in different spaces, the company with a token furthest to the right operates next.</p>
