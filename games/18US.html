<h3>1.2 - Does the price of a private company drop by 5 for no sale in the first round?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>2.9 - Can you buy a certificate and immediately sell a certificate in the same company?</h3>

<p>No. All selling precedes all buying.</p>

<h3>2.11 - What ends a share dealing round?</h3>

<p>Each player consecutively not making a purchase or a sale. The priority then goes to the player after the one who last made a purchase or a sale.</p>

<h3>3.1 - Do you lay the base station token immediately upon floating?</h3>

<p>All base station tokens start the game on the map.</p>

<h3>3.2 - How many shares must be sold for a company to float?</h3>

<h3>3.3 - Does a company get full capitalisation upon floating?</h3>

<p>Yes, when initially floated. 4-share and 5-share companies gain additional capital later on.</p>

<h3>3.4 - How is a share company&#39;s initial (par) price determined?</h3>

<p>The price is set by the player who purchases the President&#39;s certificate, choosing a value selected from a range of predefined prices.</p>

<p>The highest value company that has not operated operates next.  If more than one company occupies the same space, the&nbsp; company with a token on top operates first.</p>

<p>New arrivals are placed below existing tokens.</p>

<h3>5.1 - Where can you make an initial tile lay?</h3>

<h3>5.2 - Can you lay two tiles in a turn?</h3>

<p>Yes, for Systems. Land Grant companies can lay up to three yellow tiles or lay two yellow tiles and upgrade one yellow tile to green if it can pay any required costs from its treasury.</p>

<h3>5.3 - Must a tile replacement extend existing track?</h3>

<p>Semi-restrictive.</p>

<h3>5.4 - Do villages upgrade?</h3>

<p>Villages arrive due to upgrades to plain yellow track tiles. They then stay as villages, acquiring more connections and scoring more.</p>

<h3>6.1 - Cost of station markers</h3>

<p>0, then 20*hex distance measured along route from nearest existing marker.</p>

<h3>6.2 - Can you lay more than one station marker per turn?</h3>

<p>No, except for a Land Grant company that may be required to place two tokens if it creates a Junction Town and then connects to a qualifying city, which requires conversion to a 10-share company, which in turn requires it to place its doubling token.</p>

<h3>6.3 - Where can you lay a station marker?</h3>

<p>The newly-laid station marker must be reachable from one of the laying company&#39;s existing station markers by an arbitrarily large train.</p>

<h3>6.4 - When is a company&#39;s first station marker laid?</h3>

<p>At the start of the game.</p>

<h3>7.1 - Can you run into a city completely filled by rival station markers?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>7.2 - Can you do a run that passes through a city completely filled by rival station markers?</h3>

<p>Only if the company&#39;s or System&#39;s doubling token is in the city.</p>

<h3>7.3 - Unusual rules about running</h3>

<p>A train may run through a city fully occupied by blocking tokens if the company&#39;s or System&#39;s doubling token is in the city. An Express train that runs a coast-to-coast route applies a doubling bonus to any single city on its route. If the chosen city is already doubled by a x2 token, it is quadrupled. Freight trains earn the value of cities and junction towns that contain the company&#39;s or system&#39;s tokens. Freight bonuses that vary according to the phase are paid to companies that own classic trains (2, 3 or 4) or freight trains (2G, 3G or 4G).</p>

<h3>7.4 - Can one train run to two stations on the same tile?</h3>

<p>Yes, but only when the two cities are separate from each other.</p>

<h3>7.5 - Is double-heading allowed?</h3>

<p>When plain yellow track tiles are upgraded to villages (junction towns) the company must place a token on the hex. If it cannot place the token it cannot do the upgrade.</p>

<h3>7.7 - Must the maximum possible revenue be claimed?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>8.1 - Does stock move right for payment of dividends?</h3>

<p>Only if the dividend paid out equals or exceeds the current share price. From phase 5E/4G, if a 10-share company delcares a dividend that equals or exceeds twice the current market value, it moves two spaces to the right.</p>

<h3>8.2 - What dividend payments go into the company&#39;s treasury?</h3>

<p>Those for shares in the bank pool.</p>

<h3>9.3 - Can trains be sold back to the bank?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>9.4 - When a company is forced to buy a train and cannot buy one with its own means, what train may it then buy?</h3>

<p>The next train available from the bank. If more than one type is available, the President may choose which one to buy, even if this then requires him to provide additional funds that would not be required for another available train.</p>

<h3>9.5 - Must a minor company buy a train if it does not have one?</h3>

<p>Not applicable.</p>
